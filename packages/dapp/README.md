# ABCD - A Blockchain Commitment Device 

A [commitment device](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commitment_device) that helps you achieve your goals all secured on the blockchain. **Stake your crypto in your goals**. Get your money back if you complete the goal. Lose the money to a project of your choice if you don't complete your goals.

Recipent options for where your money should go should you not complete your goal 
1. Should not be buying assets for user's wallet's  
     - Because then user's would never complete their goals as buying crypto is usually something people would like to do more of 
2. Could go to seperate blockchain projects as donations 
3. If we can find public addresses of PACs or other anti-charities we could do that as well
