Scheduler
	Can we deploy a lambda that runs on a schedule?
		This probably isnt the fastest way to get something deployed there must be something more simpler
		Would need to spin up a new lambda everytime the button is clicked for a new contract
		Could do this by createing the code for the function and taking an input in for the deadline date.

	Run your own API on EC2 that manges all the jobs?
		expensive

	Run a server locally
		This would be pretty unreliable 

	Use Chainlink right away
		Yeah this should probably have been the solution from the beginning. Lets try it out.
